course</a> on
<em>Introduction to Infographics and Data Visualization</em>, run by the
<a href="http://knightcenter.utexas.edu/">Knight Center for Journalism in the
Americas</a> and taught by <a href="http://www.thefunctionalart.com/">Alberto
Cairo</a>. Although both of us have years
of experience visualizing experiment results, the areas of infographics
and presenting data for the general public are things where we don't
have much experience. And in any case there's always something you can
learn about how to present data, even if its 'only' for a paper or
conference presentation. In addition, interactive graphics are becoming
more and more important, and happily Alberto is covering those in the
course too. For me its also a new experience to take part in an online
course but perhaps more importantly in a course from an American
university (<a href="http://www.utexas.edu/">University of Texas</a>, in this
case). There are short lectures to watch, lots and lots and lots to read
and "quizes", something I think I only experienced from an American
lecturer at York. Anyway, none of that is complaint, its just
interesting, and for me a bit weird to have university deadlines again
after almost 6 years.</p>
<p>This post is about the first week's assignment, which was to examine one
of a set of infographics and give some critique. I chose a rather
"fun"-loooking graphic that examined <a href="http://www.flipkey.com/blog/2012/10/10/how-to-travel-like-a-president/">travel expenses of Obama and
Romney</a>
on the campaign trail in 2012.Â Overall I found the graphic interesting,
and the liberal pasting of photos/logos all over the place kept it
colorful and entertaining, even if it didn't add much to understanding.</p>
<p>In terms of understanding, one simple improvement would have been to
order the state donation data by donation and also split it into two:
democrat and republican. It might also be nice to see normalization of
donations by population of the state. California is a very populous
state. Making comparisons was really difficult for me. The data is easy
to find (I did it for the whole campaign, sources: X, Y: ) and I've done
a couple of quick example plots:</p>
<p><img alt="Donations by state" src="/files/PlotDonationsByStateComplete.png"></p>
<p>Furthermore, a scatterplot of some kind showing the amount of money
spent in campaigning, or even just days of travel in the state, vs. the
amount in donations from the state, would have been interesting.</p>
<p>I do ask myself why the concentration on donations? Obviously campaigns
need money, but isn't the main aim to motivate supporters to raise
awareness and also to motivate them to vote? I'm not from the US, so
maybe I'm not familiar with the main aims of rallies and tours.</p>
<p>Although the graphic presents some fun facts, it is hard to ascertain
what "effect" the money had except for donations, and even these are not
plotted in anyway against the effort spent on each state (a simple
scatter plot, for example, would have made comparison of "returns on
investment" possible). One can do it for Ohio just because it is there
in plain text. Below is a sketch of what I mean:</p>
<p><img alt="Visits vs. Donations" src="/files/VisitsVsDonations.jpg"></p>
<p>Apart from donations, the addition of some before and after polling data
might have helped. I haven't had time to search out the data there, but
I guess one could show the "swing" in direction democrat or republic
with a bar on each side showing the amount of days or money spent in
travel on the state. The money could be normalized such that it is
plotted with respect to the total money spent by both campaigns, and
then labelled with the actual \$ or days sum. I made a sketch of what I
mean - probably one doesn't need to do it for all states - just ones
with a large change and/or large amounts of money spent:</p>
<p><img alt="Poll Shift" src="/files/PollShift.jpg"></p>
<p>One small thing - regarding the number of hotel visits - why is the
difference so big - do some hotels like to give the President free
lodging? Some background info would have helped.</p>
<p>Overall, the graphic is interesting, but I am immediately drawn to ask
more questions, which are not necessarily relating to travel. I know the
author wanted to make a graphic about travel in the campaign, but I fear
it is too narrow a focus to answer the questions it brings up.</p>
