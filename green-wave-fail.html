</footer><!-- /.post-info -->        <p>In Munich we have a few "green waves" - sets of traffic lights along
arterial streets that are coordinated for a certain speed so that
vehicles can move through the city without stopping. Although they're a
nice idea, they seem to fool many a driver into thinking they're on the
Autobahn. That's my unscientific opinion based on observation of the two
streets that cut through the University where I work,
<a href="http://www.tum.de/">TUM</a>. This week, for whatever reason (maybe it had
nothing to do with the signalization or speed, who knows) something went
wrong at the intersection beside our building. One car ended up on its
roof and the driver was seriously injured. You can read all about it
<a href="http://www.merkur-online.de/lokales/muenchen/zentrum/arcisstrasse-auto-ueberschlaegt-sich-2830220.html">here</a>.
What was more interesting to me than the photos and details however were
the comments below. One person who lives nearby dared to say that the
constant barrage of fast-moving vehicles makes for a very unpleasant
environent. That provoked a pretty incredible response. Munich seems to
be really split down the middle: those who love driving, and those who
hate it, or at least see it as a more mundane means to an end. And
Munich, one of whose largest employers is BMW, seems to think it can
have it all: freedom and high speed for cars even in the inner city, as
well aiming to become the
<a href="http://www.walk21munich.com/frontend/index.php">walking</a> and
<a href="http://www.radlhauptstadt.muenchen.de/">biking</a> capital of Germany.</p>
