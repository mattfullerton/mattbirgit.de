Its been a rough couple of weeks with sickness in the family, and I'm a
bit behind with the course. Nevertheless after pouring over some sample
data for week 3, I've taken a stab at the exercise. I haven't had time
to look at other people's ideas/entries yet, but I'm excited to see
them, as I feel like mine is lacking something somewhere. And of course,
there's probably a few different ways to show what's important, and
different stories to tell. The data can be found
here: <http://www.highereddata.aft.org/instit/national/tenure_rank.cfm>,
although apparently there's a small error ("In the line "assistance - On
tenure track" displays a growth of  14.293 and 31,3%. This is an error
(copied from line below , "non tenure track"). The correct number is
16.709 which corresponds to 19,95%."
- <http://open.journalismcourses.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1448>). I
used the corrected data.

I took a quick look at the data to try and figure out what was going on.
The biggest change seemed to be in the numbers of lecturers, but as they
are a somewhat small group, it took some thinking to figure out how to
show it best. I mislabelled years in places, but overall the sketches
are just to give an idea of what I would do and much of the plotting is
numerically inaccurate, even bars relative to another. I would use
mouseovers to show more details (shown in some places), and probably add
a percentage change label here and there (not shown). All the images
except the final one are larger than the actual resolution, downloading
them/opening them will allow you to see more detail.
