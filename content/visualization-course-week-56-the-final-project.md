My final project compares the price of making longer journeys by car or
train in Germany, and also the change in these costs over time. There
are many more things it would be fun to explore: the impact of fuel tax
in Germany, or the breakdown of costs in car ownership, but hopefully
this still gives some insights as it is. Clicking on the graphic below
will open the PDF.
