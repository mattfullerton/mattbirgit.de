Two weeks ago we started ordering food from a group of local farmers,
who deliver organically grown food. This week we got a huge pumpkin so I
started searching the internet for ideas of what to do with it. Here is
the first meal that came out of it: a potato-pumpkin curry. Matt and I
agreed, it's very yummy and will be served again in the future.
