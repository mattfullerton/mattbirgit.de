We've had a few variations of this cake recently for various occasions
and thought it was time to finally write it up, so as to reduce stress
the next time it has to be made!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ingredients:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200g Ground coconut&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;140g Ground almonds, alternatively 100g ground almonds and 40g
    almond flour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;6 eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200g butter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 sachet vanilla sugar (\~12g)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 tsp. Baking powder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;200g dark chocolate flakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;50g sugar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instructions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Soften butter. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add all ingredients except 40g of the chocolate flakes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put into buttered tin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bake for 40m at 140° (fan oven)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When done, sprinkle the rest of the chocolate flakes while still hot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

A tool for exploring the data on disasters from 1990 to present.
Clicking on a dot will show more data on each incident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

I'm ashamed to say that I had precious little knowledge of clothing
factory disasters in Bangladesh (particularly Dhaka, the capital) before
the recent &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Savar_building_collapse"&gt;Savar Building
Collapse&lt;/a&gt;
that made a big impact in the headlines. Years ago I tried to
demonstrate some concern about sweatshops by not buying stuff from GAP
(not that I could really afford it anyway) but over the years I've
suppressed the worries with the vague notion that after so much public
concern, things must be better by now. I still can't tell you much about
Sweatshop conditions, but Birgit and I did look into the history of
disasters within the clothing industry in Bangladesh. We didn't have to
look too far to find shocking catalogues of death tolls due essentially
to poor building standards and inspection. A few reports that deal with
the history of incidents and their causes are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cleanclothes.org/resources/publications/2012-11-hazardousworkplaces.pdf/at_download/file"&gt;Hazardous workplaces: Making the Bangladesh Garment industry
safe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.fairwear.org/ul/cms/fck-uploaded/archive/2010-01/bangladesh_fwf_country_study.pdf"&gt;Fair Wear Foundation Background Study BANGLADESH, Fair Wear Foundation,
2006&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wanting to do something, and, we freely admit, wanting to try out some
web stuff for something useful and of interest to people, we put
together a year-by-year visualization of the disasters. Most of them are
in the area of Dhaka, but zooming out will reveal a couple in the port
city of Chittagong aswell. We come to a total of 1801 deaths from 1990
to 2013. Many death totals are disputed, and this number is probably
quite conservative. The source(s) of the information and, where
available, details on each incident can be viewed by clicking on the
dots. You can take a look at the draft version here:
&lt;a href="http://clothing.norainnosun.de/"&gt;clothing.norainnosun.de&lt;/a&gt;. This was a
learning experience for us in multiple ways, concerning the technical
difficulties there are a few comments below, if you're not interested in
that sort of thing you probably can stop reading now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used this project as a way to try out
&lt;a href="http://www.cartodb.com/"&gt;CartoDB&lt;/a&gt;, a system for quickly creating
visualizations of geographical data. Although the visualization does
still grab its data from a CartoDB database using their API, we quickly
ran into the limits of what their visualization system can cope with.
The main problem was that the creation of the layers displaying data is
done automatically based on a query, which meant a new database query
for different data sets (in our cases, each year). It is also done using
rendered tiles, making everything slow (although I am new to this and
can't be 100% certain that there isn't a way to do it with vector
graphics). By doing the layer generation ourselves (using
&lt;a href="http://leafletjs.com/"&gt;Leaflet&lt;/a&gt;, which CartoDB can also use),
separately from the database query, we could easily generate vector
graphics layers based on whatever data we wanted and have it displayed
or not more or less instantly, which was necessary for the slider to
work. What is however still very cool about CartoDB is that you can
essentially do database queries directly with Javascript. Their
georeferencing facilties were also good for getting the points on the
right place on the map based on addresses. As for the stacked bar chart,
that is done using &lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;d3.js&lt;/a&gt;, a great library for data
plotting. It is (for me) horribly low level, but I'm gradually coming to
understand it. Not enough however, to make my own dynamic stacked bar
chart in a few minutes, for that we adapted &lt;a href="http://bl.ocks.org/benjchristensen/1488375"&gt;code kindly placed online
by Ben Christensen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In Munich we have a few "green waves" - sets of traffic lights along
arterial streets that are coordinated for a certain speed so that
vehicles can move through the city without stopping. Although they're a
nice idea, they seem to fool many a driver into thinking they're on the
Autobahn. That's my unscientific opinion based on observation of the two
streets that cut through the University where I work,
&lt;a href="http://www.tum.de/"&gt;TUM&lt;/a&gt;. This week, for whatever reason (maybe it had
nothing to do with the signalization or speed, who knows) something went
wrong at the intersection beside our building. One car ended up on its
roof and the driver was seriously injured. You can read all about it
&lt;a href="http://www.merkur-online.de/lokales/muenchen/zentrum/arcisstrasse-auto-ueberschlaegt-sich-2830220.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
What was more interesting to me than the photos and details however were
the comments below. One person who lives nearby dared to say that the
constant barrage of fast-moving vehicles makes for a very unpleasant
environent. That provoked a pretty incredible response. Munich seems to
be really split down the middle: those who love driving, and those who
hate it, or at least see it as a more mundane means to an end. And
Munich, one of whose largest employers is BMW, seems to think it can
have it all: freedom and high speed for cars even in the inner city, as
well aiming to become the
&lt;a href="http://www.walk21munich.com/frontend/index.php"&gt;walking&lt;/a&gt; and

My final project compares the price of making longer journeys by car or
train in Germany, and also the change in these costs over time. There
are many more things it would be fun to explore: the impact of fuel tax
in Germany, or the breakdown of costs in car ownership, but hopefully
this still gives some insights as it is. Clicking on the graphic below
will open the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;

Still way behind, our challenge for week 4 was to take something from a
92-page KPMG report and make an infographic. As much of the course
content for week 4 was about cartography, I felt I needed to get a map
in there somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, I only used one page from the report, which as a bar graph of
where countries start the highest top tax rate (the report was about the
highest rates, which are supposed to be somewhat representative). Mostly
ignoring the fact that the number of tax rates probably makes a big
difference, I thought it might be interesting the correlate/normalize
the data against the household income, which I found some older data for
via. Wikipedia. I had to manually type in the numbers from the KPMG
report, so I hope they are right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week I tried to make less of an effort to use lots of data
(multiple tabs, etc.) and more of an effort to find/tell a story.
Somehow I found that easier with this data than with the &lt;a href="http://mattbirgit.de/node/46"&gt;last
one&lt;/a&gt;. Clicking on the preview below will
load the PDF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mattbirgit.de/sites/default/files/How%20rich%20is%20rich.pdf"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://mattbirgit.de/sites/default/files/How-rich-is-rich.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I meant to note on there somewhere what exactly median household income
is - it is: "Annual median equivalised disposable household income in
USD at current prices and current PPPs in 2007"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should also point out that despite some real data in there, this
should be taken as a draft - the color map is from something else in
Wikimedia commons
(&lt;a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/British_expats_countrymap.svg"&gt;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/British_expats_countrymap.svg&lt;/a&gt;)
and doesn't relate to the data, and the image is of course static just
showing an idea of how the mouseover interactivity would work.&lt;/p&gt;

Its been a rough couple of weeks with sickness in the family, and I'm a
bit behind with the course. Nevertheless after pouring over some sample
data for week 3, I've taken a stab at the exercise. I haven't had time
to look at other people's ideas/entries yet, but I'm excited to see
them, as I feel like mine is lacking something somewhere. And of course,
there's probably a few different ways to show what's important, and
different stories to tell. The data can be found
here: &lt;a href="http://www.highereddata.aft.org/instit/national/tenure_rank.cfm"&gt;http://www.highereddata.aft.org/instit/national/tenure_rank.cfm&lt;/a&gt;,
although apparently there's a small error ("In the line "assistance - On
tenure track" displays a growth of  14.293 and 31,3%. This is an error
(copied from line below , "non tenure track"). The correct number is
16.709 which corresponds to 19,95%."
- &lt;a href="http://open.journalismcourses.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1448"&gt;http://open.journalismcourses.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=1448&lt;/a&gt;). I
used the corrected data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a quick look at the data to try and figure out what was going on.
The biggest change seemed to be in the numbers of lecturers, but as they
are a somewhat small group, it took some thinking to figure out how to
show it best. I mislabelled years in places, but overall the sketches
are just to give an idea of what I would do and much of the plotting is
numerically inaccurate, even bars relative to another. I would use
mouseovers to show more details (shown in some places), and probably add
a percentage change label here and there (not shown). All the images
except the final one are larger than the actual resolution, downloading
them/opening them will allow you to see more detail.&lt;/p&gt;

I haven't had as much time to get into the course this week in terms of
making illustrations, or even any helpful criticism of my chosen
graphic. There was a lot to read and watch - the general theme was on
what forms to use for visualization and how to use knowledge about
vision perception to shape design choices for the benefit of the user.
The graphics to critique this week were interactive, which raised the
slight problem (for me at any rate, and only for the two that I looked
at!) that they didn't necessarily have the aim of being pieces of
journalism (and journalism is the overriding theme of the course, as far
as I can tell) and hence it was hard to know whether it was fair to make
criticisms or not. Nevertheless for the fascinating graphic of &lt;a href="http://workshop.chromeexperiments.com/projects/armsglobe/?ModPagespeed=noscript"&gt;Small
Arms and Ammunition - Imports &amp;amp;
Exports&lt;/a&gt; [Caution,
needs Chrome], I thought that given it's not a graphic pretending to be
ready for print on a newspaper website but purely a data exploration
tool (in my opinion), it is very functional, but doesn't tell a story.
Which of course is a pity because after only playing with it for a short
time I can see there are a few stories in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of missing data, I was asking myself why do the UK and USA
spend more on arms imports than they gain in exports when they are both
big arms producers (and in the UK's case historically very good at
subsidising their own arms industry). But then I realized the numbers
for internal purchase of arms (which are neither import or export) are
not there. It would have been nice to have those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that the dots along the lines took aways from the functionality
as I couldn't see other stuff clearly. I also would have appreciated
only seeing one country label at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found the graphic useful and informative. I don't think it
should be judged according to the the normal infographics/journalism
criteria, as I don't think that's what the author(s) were aiming for.
But if we do apply those criteria, there are many criticisms that could
be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Birgit and I (Matt) have enrolled ourselves in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course"&gt;massive open online
course&lt;/a&gt; on
&lt;em&gt;Introduction to Infographics and Data Visualization&lt;/em&gt;, run by the
&lt;a href="http://knightcenter.utexas.edu/"&gt;Knight Center for Journalism in the
Americas&lt;/a&gt; and taught by &lt;a href="http://www.thefunctionalart.com/"&gt;Alberto
Cairo&lt;/a&gt;. Although both of us have years
of experience visualizing experiment results, the areas of infographics
and presenting data for the general public are things where we don't
have much experience. And in any case there's always something you can
learn about how to present data, even if its 'only' for a paper or
conference presentation. In addition, interactive graphics are becoming
more and more important, and happily Alberto is covering those in the
course too. For me its also a new experience to take part in an online
course but perhaps more importantly in a course from an American
university (&lt;a href="http://www.utexas.edu/"&gt;University of Texas&lt;/a&gt;, in this
case). There are short lectures to watch, lots and lots and lots to read
and "quizes", something I think I only experienced from an American
lecturer at York. Anyway, none of that is complaint, its just
interesting, and for me a bit weird to have university deadlines again
after almost 6 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is about the first week's assignment, which was to examine one
of a set of infographics and give some critique. I chose a rather
"fun"-loooking graphic that examined &lt;a href="http://www.flipkey.com/blog/2012/10/10/how-to-travel-like-a-president/"&gt;travel expenses of Obama and
Romney&lt;/a&gt;
on the campaign trail in 2012. Overall I found the graphic interesting,
and the liberal pasting of photos/logos all over the place kept it
colorful and entertaining, even if it didn't add much to understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of understanding, one simple improvement would have been to
order the state donation data by donation and also split it into two:
democrat and republican. It might also be nice to see normalization of
donations by population of the state. California is a very populous
state. Making comparisons was really difficult for me. The data is easy
to find (I did it for the whole campaign, sources: X, Y: ) and I've done
a couple of quick example plots:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://mattbirgit.de/sites/default/files/PlotDonationsByStateComplete.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, a scatterplot of some kind showing the amount of money
spent in campaigning, or even just days of travel in the state, vs. the
amount in donations from the state, would have been interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do ask myself why the concentration on donations? Obviously campaigns
need money, but isn't the main aim to motivate supporters to raise
awareness and also to motivate them to vote? I'm not from the US, so
maybe I'm not familiar with the main aims of rallies and tours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the graphic presents some fun facts, it is hard to ascertain
what "effect" the money had except for donations, and even these are not
plotted in anyway against the effort spent on each state (a simple
scatter plot, for example, would have made comparison of "returns on
investment" possible). One can do it for Ohio just because it is there
in plain text. Below is a sketch of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://mattbirgit.de/sites/default/files/VisitsVsDonations.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from donations, the addition of some before and after polling data
might have helped. I haven't had time to search out the data there, but
I guess one could show the "swing" in direction democrat or republic
with a bar on each side showing the amount of days or money spent in
travel on the state. The money could be normalized such that it is
plotted with respect to the total money spent by both campaigns, and
then labelled with the actual \$ or days sum. I made a sketch of what I
mean - probably one doesn't need to do it for all states - just ones
with a large change and/or large amounts of money spent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://mattbirgit.de/sites/default/files/PollShift.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One small thing - regarding the number of hotel visits - why is the
difference so big - do some hotels like to give the President free
lodging? Some background info would have helped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, the graphic is interesting, but I am immediately drawn to ask
more questions, which are not necessarily relating to travel. I know the
author wanted to make a graphic about travel in the campaign, but I fear
it is too narrow a focus to answer the questions it brings up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

After purchasing an Aldi sewing machine and nice organic cotton fabric,
I finally tried my sewing skills (not sure where they would have come
from). Here is the result. Well, not quite perfect, but I'm quite happy
considering it's my first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago we started ordering food from a group of local farmers,
who deliver organically grown food. This week we got a huge pumpkin so I
started searching the internet for ideas of what to do with it. Here is
the first meal that came out of it: a potato-pumpkin curry. Matt and I
agreed, it's very yummy and will be served again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Potato-pumkin
curry" src="http://mattbirgit.de/sites/default/files/potato_pumkpkin_0.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2 people:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;300-400g of potatoes (cut in cubes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;300-400g of pumpkin (cut in cubes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 can of coconut milk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;200ml vegetable broth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 onion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 piece of ginger (about the size of a walnut), cut into small bits&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 clove of garlic (crushed)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 bay leaf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;salt and pepper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.5 teasp. of coriander&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.5 teasp of cumin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;0.5 teasp of cayenne pepper&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 teasp. of curry powder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-3 tablesp. of oil&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add spices to pan and to briefly heat them up. Add oil, garlic, ginger
and onion. Wait until onion becomes soft, then add potato and pumpkin
cubes. After about 5-10 min, add vegetable broth and bay leaf. Let it
simmer for about 20min until potatoes and pumkin are soft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Add coconut milk and salt/pepper as needed and  let it simmer a little
longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serve with rice or naan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
